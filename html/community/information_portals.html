<p>The <strong>bitcoin.org</strong> website is the non-profit Bitcoin information project that was started by Satoshi Nakamoto in <a href="http://whois.domaintools.com/bitcoin.org">August of 2008</a>. Work on the project was quickly taken over by Martti Malmi, also known as Sirius.</p>
<p>The website has been used for a variety of purposes, such as hosting Bitcoin Core binaries, recommending Bitcoin wallets, as well as explaining the basic ideas behind Bitcoin.</p>

<h2 id="bitcoin-wiki">Bitcoin Wiki</h2>
<p>The <strong>Bitcoin Wiki</strong> is a collaboratively edited encyclopedic reference on Bitcoin topics, that was started by Martii Malmi in April of 2010. The project was later taken over by Mark Karpelès.</p>
<h3 id="contributions">Contributions</h3>
<p>Although the Bitcoin Wiki is conceptually a collaborative venture, the actual activity on the project has remained at low levels and the bar to collaborate has been raised to a high level to account for a lack of interest in managing the project and the pressure of peer editors to reduce the quality of the content by promoting their own interests.</p>
<p>Under Mark Karpelès&#39;s management, an effort to raise a bounty to offer to quality contributions was made, resulting in a collection of five hundred bitcoins, however <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin.it_Wiki_Contributors%27_Award">this bounty was never paid out</a> and is unaccounted for.</p>
